## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to my Github!


Hi! I'm **SandyGCabanes**, a certified Data Analyst with business analysis and extensive marketing research background.  I enjoy manipulating and digging into data to produce insights that answer business questions.   

- I have been volunteering as a Community Leader at Data Engineering Pilipinas as one of the Moderators.
- I lead the State of the Community survey initiative. I designed, launched, processed data, analyzed data and presented findings.
- I started the DEP DataMasters initiative to help like-minded individuals gain confidence in presenting data-related topics, as well as gain mock interview experience.
- I have many projects that use Python, Tableau, R, Power BI, SQL and Power query for Excel.
- I also have projects that explore ETL in Google Cloud, AWS and Azure.  Will continue to add to these cloud projects.
- Feel free to browse through my repositories!
